# Pranx

Pranx — the next of Preact.  
A lightweight, Next.js-like fullstack metaframework for Preact apps.

> Note: Pranx is currently being rewritten from scratch. The API and internals are unstable and subject to change.

## Why Pranx?

Pranx aims to provide a minimal, highly-performant fullstack developer experience inspired by Next.js but optimized for Preact and small bundles. Focus areas:

- Fast server-side rendering (SSR)
- Tiny client runtime and hydration
- File-system-based routing and simple API routes
- Extensible build & dev tooling with a small surface area

## Key features

- Preact-first rendering with minimal client payload
- File-system routing
- SSR, SSG, ISG and CSR
- API routes for server endpoints
- Easy static export / SSG support
- Opinionated defaults with extensibility hooks

## Project status

- Current state: full rewrite in progress
- Examples located in `examples/basic`
- Expect breaking changes until v1.0



Deployment targets: Node servers, serverless platforms, edge runtimes (dependant on handler compile target).

## Contributing

- Open issues for bugs / feature requests
- PRs welcomed — prefer small, focused changes
